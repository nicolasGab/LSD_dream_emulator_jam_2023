## Welcome to the annual LSDJAM event for 2023! This is the 4th LSDJAM!

Create an interactive experience based on dreams to celebrate the release of LSD: Dream Emulator. 

LSD is an exploration game where the player explores surreal dreamscapes without any objectives. The dreams in the game are based on a dream diary that was kept for ten years. Originally created by Japanese artist Osamu Sato, the game was intended to be unlike any other game available at the time.
